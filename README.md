## UX

The Users targetted by this website are, Gamers and content creators. I want people to use my website for reccomendations and to get more people to join the social media pages. My website is easy to use and to get someone interested quickly without too much information to overwhelm you. A lot of pictures are used to keep the audience engaged and to showcase what will be awaiting you in the game.

## User stories

The goal of this website is to get people interested in this game and to get recognised as a good content provider on the internet. The following points are from my user point of view:

* As a user, I want to be able to open the website and navigate easily.
* As a user, I want to see what the monster hunter game is all about.
* As a user, I want see what kind of content there is in the game.
* As a user, I want to be able to join a group for frequent content updates and upcoming events.
* As a user, I want to learn tips and tricks from other people who play this game in a community.

## Strategy

I want the website to be user-friendly and easy to use on all platforms, the users need to be able to navigate through the website and get the information and content they have come for without difficulty.

## Scope

For the users, I want them to see brief introduction to what the game entails without having too much information but enough to get them wanting more. Having a way of joining a social community to extra content is a good way of making it so they are then actively looking rather than throwing it in their face. Having lots of pictures but having the balance between the text and images is key.

## Structure

The structure of this website is in a long single page with different sections to scroll to, as it is better for the user experience when being introduced to a game for the first time. In the header I have the navigation bar that follows you down the page making it easy to navigate to any section wherever you are on the page.

**Website Sections:**

1. **_Monster Hunter (home/first section):_** Brief introduction to the game and what it's about.
2. **_Monsters:_** The monsters section show cases the kind of monsters you will encounter.
3. **_Weapons:_** The weapons section show cases the differet types of weapons you can create.
4. **_Areas:_** The Areas section show cases the different kinds of areas you will go to.
5. **_Contact:_** The contact section gives you the input fields for basic user information and a bit of fun with choosing a weapon type, there is also the social media links you can click on to go straight to the page.

## Skeleton

I designed the website to be simple but show case all the relevant information and pictures required to get the users interested.

**Wireframe**

I used balsamiq software recommended by my mentor to create my wireframe for my website. The wireframe shows the very basic structure of what I saw in my head and gave guidence in to how i wanted my website structured.

You can view the screenshots from my wireframe from clicking the following:

## Surface

The Colors I have used in the website are used to match the theme of the images, and matches the main colors seen in the game. I chose the color of silver mainly for the weapons section, as it is the colour of steel and wanted to have that relation in the website.

### Color palette used:

## Technologies

I have used HTML for the main page structure, images and text content.
I have used CSS for the styling and positioning of all the HTML content.
I have used Balsamiq for the wireframe plan of my website.

## Bugs

A bug I encountered when creating this website was with the header section, where the navigation links wouldn't show aligned to the right of the header and central.

My mentor showed me some flex-box tricks to get this to sit properly in the header:

* display: flex;
* justify-content: space-between;
* align-items: center;

Whereas I had tried using inline-block.
